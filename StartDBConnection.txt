# How to connect a Mysql database to R Studio
#
# Step 1: create a MySQL database
#
# This database has to run on the MySQL server. You can do this in multiple ways
#
# The hard way:
#
# Create the database directly on the MySQL server:
# Open MySQL Workbench
# Choose: "Database" and then "Connect to Database"
# Choose for "Stored Connection" your MySQL server. Something like: LocalInstance MySQL80
# Press ok (leave the rest at the default values)
# You are now on the MySQL server.
#
# Choose "File" an then "New Model", or <CRTL> N or use the "new model" icon. (all the same).
# Choose a name for your database, something like "testdb"
# Press "Apply"
# Just leave it like that and press "Apply" 
# Now for some SQL magic
# Open a new SQL tab for executing queries. Icon most left on the screen.
# Do something like this:
#
SHOW DATABASES;
USE testdb;
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    PersonID int,
    LastName varchar(255),
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Address varchar(255),
    City varchar(255)
);
INSERT INTO Persons (PersonID, LastName, FirstName, Address, City)
VALUES ('1', 'Bakker', 'Taco', 'Leeuwetand 18', 'Monnickendam');
INSERT INTO Persons (PersonID, LastName, FirstName, Address, City)
VALUES ('2', 'Bakker', 'Nick', 'Leeuwetand 18', 'Monnickendam');
#
# execute with the lightning bolt icon. Enjoy your new database!

# The more easy way to create a MYSQL database:
#
# You can also create the schema (database) completely in MySQL Workbench
# But understand that you then only create a local instance.
# You have to sync it with the server.
#
# So in the MySQL Workbench create a new model
# Choose "File" an then "New Model", or <CRTL> N or use the "new model" icon. (all the same).
# Create the model, at least one table and some content.
# ok ok I will explain this in more detail later.
# But this should be easy.
#
# Now click in the menu on "Database" and then "Synchronize Model" or <CRTL><SHIFT>z 
# Make sure the Stored Connection points to your MySQL server.
# Click "Next" and follow the instructions.
# Your local database is now on the server.
#
# Step 2:
# Create a user that can actually connect from R Studio to MySQL.
#
# To do this the user needs a "STANDARD" encryption type.
# Or you will get this error: Authentication plugin 'caching_sha2_password' cannot be loaded:
#
# In MySQL Workbench: open the connection to the MySQL Server.
# Choose: "Database" and then "Connect to Database"
# Choose for "Stored Connection" your MySQL server. Something like: LocalInstance MySQL80
# Press ok (leave the rest at the default values)
# You are now on the MySQL server.
# (Or maybe you had this tab still open)
#
# On the left of your screen, under Management: Choose: "Users and Privileges"
# you see a list of users.
# Click on "Add Account"
# Fill in the fields. It will nag you on a strong password, but "geheim" is also possible :-)
# Make sure that "Authentication Type" is "Standard". Or it will probably not work.
# Goto Adminitrative roles Tab and select the roles. DBA is most easy for testing. Press "Apply" 
# Check the user list. Should be added.
#
# Ok you're all set, Step 3: let's go to R Studio
#
# First execute these commands to get the necessary libraries 

install.packages("DBI")
install.packages("RMySQL")
library(DBI)
library(RMySQL)

# Now open the database named "testdb" and assign it to a dataframe called "conMySQL", with user "henk"

conMySQL <- dbConnect(MySQL(), dbname="testdb", user="henk",password= "a1b2c3d4E5_!HdV", host="localhost")

# And show the tables

dbListTables(conMySQL)

# And write some data back to the database in MySQL

dbWriteTable(conMySQL,name="population", value=population , append=FALSE, row.names=FALSE, overwrite=FALSE)
